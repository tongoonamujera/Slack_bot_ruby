# Ruby object Oriented Programming

> In this project, we were requested  build a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes. In the This milestone we were only requested to create two folders that are lib( for the game logic) and bin(with the [executable file]called ‚Äúmain.rb‚Äù)
### TIC TAC TOE GAME INSTRUCTIONS
- Tic Tac Toe is board game played on a board with a 3 squared by 3 squared grid.
- The players are assigned their own symbols to place on the board cells
- Player 1 will be assigned the O symbol.
- Player 2 will be assigned the X symbol.
- Players take turn to place their symbols on the board.
- The grid is numbered from 1 to 9.

- You place the symbol by choosing the cell number.
- The First Player to get 3 of her symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
