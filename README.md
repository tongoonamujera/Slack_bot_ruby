> > 4. Type ```code .``` if you are using Visual Studio Code or ```subl .``` if you are using Sublime  or ```atom .``` if you are using Atom(this is done to open your project in the code edditor)
> > 5. ## You need to add the following gems to the Gemfile
>>> 1. ```gem 'slack-ruby-bot'```
>>> 2. ```gem 'dotenv'```
>>> 3. ```gem 'wolfram'```

>>> > ``require 'json'`` <br>
>>> > ``require 'screencap'`` <br>
>>> > ``require 'imgur2'`` <br>
>>> > ``require 'rss'``
>>> > ``require 'open-uri'`` <br>
>>> > ``require_relative '../lib/commands.rb'`` <br>
>>> > ``RubyBot::App.instance.run`` <br>
